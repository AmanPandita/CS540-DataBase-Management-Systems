# What you must do


Consider the following relations:

Emp (eid (integer), ename (string), age (integer), salary (double))

Fields of types integer, double, and string occupy 4, 8, and 40 bytes, respectively. Each page (block) can fit at most one tuple (record) of the input relation. Assume that each page (block) can fit at most one record (tuple) of the input file. Implement the two-pass multi-way sorting for the file Emp.csv in C/C++ using the skeleton code posted with this assignment. The sorting should be based on the attribute eid. There are at most 22 pages available to the sort algorithm in the main memory, i.e., the size of the buffer is 22

The input relation is stored in a CSV file, i.e., each tuple is in a separate line and fields of each record are separated by commas. The file that store relation Emp is Emp.csv.
The result of the sort must be stored in a new CSV file. The file that stores the relation Emp is Emp.csv.

Your program must assume that the input file is in the current working directory, i.e., the one from which your program is running.

The program must store the result in a new CSV file with the name EmpSorted.csv in the current working directory.

Your program must run on Linux. Each student has an account on hadoop-master.engr.oregonstate.edu server, which is a Linux machine. You may use this machine to test your program if you do not have access to any other Linux machine. You can use the following bash command to connect to it:

> ssh your_onid_username@hadoop-master.engr.oregonstate.edu

Then it asks for your ONID password and probably one another question. You can access this server on campus. If you want to access from outside of campus, youâ€™ll need to use VPN to access the campus network.

You must name the file that contains the source code of the main() function main4.cpp.

You may use following commands to compile and run C++ code:

> g++ -std=c++11 main4.cpp -o main4.out > main4.out

There is no need to use double buffering in your implementation.
